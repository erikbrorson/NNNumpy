# NNNumpy
This is my ongoing project to learn more about Neual Networks using only numpy. At the moment highly inspired by the first course in the Deep Learning specialzation from coursera taught by Andrew Ng (Make sure to check it out!)

## Version 1.0

The first working version of my onging project to learn more about neural networks by implementing the models from scratch. Right now a 2 layer network that with 5 nodes in the hidden layer. The architecture looks this at the moment:

X -> LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SOFTMAX -> Y_hat
